# General C# Questions

## What is the difference between `ref` and `out` keywords in C#?

The `ref` and `out` keywords in C# both allow passing arguments by reference, but they have different initialization requirements.

### `ref`

-   **Initialization:** The variable must be initialized before being passed.
-   **Usage:** Allows reading and modifying the variable inside the method.

```csharp
using System;

public class Example
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        int number = 10;
        ModifyRef(ref number);
        Console.WriteLine(number); // Output: 20
    }

    public static void ModifyRef(ref int value)
    {
        value = 20;
    }
}
```

### `out`

-   **Initialization:** The variable does not need to be initialized before being passed.
-   **Usage:** The method must assign a value before returning.

```csharp
using System;

public class Example
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        int number;
        InitializeOut(out number);
        Console.WriteLine(number); // Output: 30
    }

    public static void InitializeOut(out int value)
    {
        value = 30;
    }
}
```

**Summary:** `ref` requires pre-initialization and can be read, while `out` does not require pre-initialization but must be assigned within the method.

## Explain the concept of Boxing and Unboxing in C#.

In C#, boxing is converting a value type (like `int`) to an `object`, storing it on the heap. Unboxing is converting the object back to the value type. Here's an example:

```csharp
int num = 123;      // Value type
object obj = num;   // Boxing
int num2 = (int)obj; // Unboxing
```

First, `num` is boxed into `obj`. Then, `obj` is unboxed back to `num2`. Boxing and unboxing have performance costs due to heap allocation and type conversion.

## What is the difference between a `class` and a `struct` in C#?

**Class:**

    -   Reference type, stored on the heap.
    -   Supports inheritance and polymorphism.
    -   Can have a destructor.
    -   Default is null if not initialized.

**Struct:**

    -   Value type, stored on the stack. - Cannot inherit from another class or struct. - No destructor. - Cannot be null, always contains a value.

Classes are used for larger, complex objects, while structs are for small, lightweight data structures.

## What are `delegates` and how are they used?

Delegates in C# are like function pointers in C++. They hold references to methods with a specific signature. They're used for callback methods and event handling.

### Example:

1. **Define a delegate:**

    ```csharp
    public delegate void DisplayMessage(string message);
    ```

2. **Create methods matching the delegate signature:**

    ```csharp
    public void ShowMessage(string message) => Console.WriteLine(message);
    ```

3. **Use the delegate:**
    ```csharp
    DisplayMessage del = ShowMessage;
    del("Hello, World!");  // Output: Hello, World!
    ```

Delegates allow methods to be passed as parameters and invoked dynamically.

## Explain the concept of `LINQ` in C#.

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) in C# allows querying data from collections (like arrays or lists) or databases using a syntax similar to SQL queries. It provides a uniform way to query and manipulate data.

### Example:

```csharp
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
// Querying an array of numbers
var evenNumbers = from num in numbers
                  where num % 2 == 0
                  select num;

foreach (var num in evenNumbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(num); // Output: 2, 4
}
```

In this example, LINQ filters even numbers from an array using a `where` clause and selects them using `select`. LINQ is powerful for data manipulation and retrieval in a concise and readable manner.

## What is the purpose of the `async` and `await` keywords in C#?

The `async` and `await` keywords in C# are used for asynchronous programming, allowing methods to run asynchronously without blocking the main thread. `async` marks a method as asynchronous, while `await` pauses the method execution until the awaited task completes.

### Example:

```csharp
public async Task<string> DownloadDataAsync(string url)
{
    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
    string result = await client.GetStringAsync(url);
    return result;
}

// Usage
var data = await DownloadDataAsync("https://example.com/data");
Console.WriteLine(data);
```

In this example, `GetStringAsync` is awaited asynchronously, allowing other tasks to run while waiting for the HTTP request to complete.

## How do you implement exception handling in C#?

In C#, exception handling is implemented using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks. The `try` block contains code that might throw an exception, `catch` handles the exception, and `finally` executes code regardless of whether an exception occurred.

### Example:

```csharp
try
{
    int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw a DivideByZeroException
}
catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Cannot divide by zero: " + ex.Message);
}
finally
{
    Console.WriteLine("Execution completed.");
}
```

In this example, dividing by zero throws an exception, which is caught and handled in the `catch` block, and `finally` ensures the final message is always printed.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

## Explain the four principles of OOP.

### Encapsulation

-   **Definition:** Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class.
-   **Purpose:** It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.
-   **Example:** Use private fields and provide public getter and setter methods.

### Inheritance

-   **Definition:** Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
-   **Purpose:** It promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy.
-   **Example:** A `Car` class inheriting from a `Vehicle` class.

### Polymorphism

-   **Definition:** Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.
-   **Purpose:** It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).
-   **Example:** A method that can take a `Shape` object and work with `Circle` or `Square` objects.

### Abstraction

-   **Definition:** Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
-   **Purpose:** It reduces complexity and allows for more efficient design and implementation.
-   **Example:** An abstract class `Animal` with an abstract method `MakeSound`, implemented by subclasses like `Dog` and `Cat`.

## Can you explain the concept of method overriding?

Method overriding in C# allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its base class.
It uses the `override` keyword and requires the base method to be marked with `virtual` or `abstract`.

### Example:

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Some sound");
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bark");
    }
}

Animal myDog = new Dog();
myDog.MakeSound(); // Output: Bark
```

In this example, `Dog` overrides the `MakeSound` method of `Animal` to provide a specific implementation.

## How do you prevent a class from being inherited in C#?

In C#, you can prevent a class from being inherited by marking it with the `sealed` keyword. A `sealed` class cannot be used as a base class.

### Example:

```csharp
public sealed class FinalClass
{
    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This class cannot be inherited.");
    }
}

// The following code will cause a compile-time error
// public class DerivedClass : FinalClass
// {
// }

FinalClass obj = new FinalClass();
obj.Display(); // Output: This class cannot be inherited.
```

In this example, `FinalClass` is marked as `sealed`, so any attempt to inherit from it will result in a compile-time error.

# Advanced C# Concepts

## What are generics in C# and how are they used?

Generics in C# allow you to define classes, methods, and structures with a placeholder for the data type. This promotes code reusability and type safety without sacrificing performance.

### Example:

1. **Generic Class:**

    ```csharp
    public class GenericList<T>
    {
        private List<T> items = new List<T>();

        public void Add(T item) => items.Add(item);
        public T Get(int index) => items[index];
    }

    var intList = new GenericList<int>();
    intList.Add(10);
    Console.WriteLine(intList.Get(0)); // Output: 10
    ```

2. **Generic Method:**

    ```csharp
    public T GenericMethod<T>(T param)
    {
        return param;
    }

    int result = GenericMethod(5);
    Console.WriteLine(result); // Output: 5
    ```

Generics ensure type safety and eliminate the need for type casting.

## How do extension methods work in C#?

Extension methods in C# add new methods to existing types without modifying them. They are defined as static methods in a static class, with the first parameter specifying the type being extended and prefixed with the `this` keyword.

### Example:

1. **Define Extension Method:**

    ```csharp
    public static class StringExtensions
    {
        public static bool IsNullOrEmpty(this string str)
        {
            return string.IsNullOrEmpty(str);
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Use Extension Method:**
    ```csharp
    string test = "Hello";
    bool result = test.IsNullOrEmpty(); // Calls the extension method
    Console.WriteLine(result); // Output: False
    ```

This example extends the `string` class with an `IsNullOrEmpty` method, allowing `string` instances to call it as if it were a native method.

## Explain the concept of reflection in C#.

Reflection in C# allows inspection and manipulation of types, methods, properties, and fields at runtime. It provides the ability to dynamically load assemblies, create instances of types, and invoke methods based on runtime information.

### Example:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Reflection;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Type type = typeof(string);
        MethodInfo[] methods = type.GetMethods();
        foreach (var method in methods)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(method.Name); // Output: Lists all methods of string type
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `typeof(string)` retrieves runtime information about the `string` type, and `GetMethods()` fetches all methods, demonstrating reflection's ability to inspect types dynamically.

## How do you create and use custom attributes in C#?

Custom attributes in C# allow adding metadata to types and members for runtime inspection. They are defined as classes deriving from `System.Attribute`.

### Example:

1. **Define Custom Attribute:**

    ```csharp
    [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Method, AllowMultiple = false)]
    public class MyCustomAttribute : Attribute
    {
        public string Description { get; }

        public MyCustomAttribute(string description)
        {
            Description = description;
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Use Custom Attribute:**

    ```csharp
    [MyCustomAttribute("This is a sample class")]
    public class MyClass
    {
        [MyCustomAttribute("This is a sample method")]
        public void MyMethod()
        {
            // Method implementation
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Retrieve Attribute at Runtime:**
    ```csharp
    MyClass obj = new MyClass();
    Type type = obj.GetType();
    var classAttribute = type.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(MyCustomAttribute), false).FirstOrDefault() as MyCustomAttribute;
    Console.WriteLine(classAttribute.Description); // Output: This is a sample class
    ```

Custom attributes provide a flexible way to annotate and retrieve additional information about types and members at runtime.

## How do you implement multi-threading programming in C#? (report generation)

Generating reports asynchronously using multi-threading in C# can improve application responsiveness. Here's an example that demonstrates thread creation for report generation and handles race conditions using synchronization techniques:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

public class ReportGenerator
{
    private static readonly object lockObj = new object();

    public void GenerateReports()
    {
        // Simulate multiple reports to generate
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() => GenerateReport("Monthly Sales Report"));
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() => GenerateReport("Quarterly Financial Report"));
        Thread thread3 = new Thread(() => GenerateReport("Annual Performance Report"));

        // Start threads concurrently
        thread1.Start();
        thread2.Start();
        thread3.Start();

        // Wait for all threads to complete
        thread1.Join();
        thread2.Join();
        thread3.Join();

        Console.WriteLine("All reports generated successfully.");
    }

    private void GenerateReport(string reportName)
    {
        // Simulate report generation
        Console.WriteLine($"Generating {reportName}...");

        // Simulate report generation time
        Thread.Sleep(3000);

        // Simulate saving report to file/database
        lock (lockObj)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Saving {reportName} to disk...");
            Thread.Sleep(2000); // Simulate file/database write time
            Console.WriteLine($"Report {reportName} saved successfully.");
        }
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        ReportGenerator generator = new ReportGenerator();
        generator.GenerateReports();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

-   `ReportGenerator` class manages report generation tasks.
-   `GenerateReports` method starts three threads to generate different reports concurrently.
-   `GenerateReport` method simulates report generation and uses `lock` to prevent race conditions when saving reports to disk.
-   `lockObj` ensures that only one thread can access the critical section (saving to disk) at a time, preventing conflicts and ensuring data integrity.

This example demonstrates how multi-threading can be used effectively in report generation tasks while handling potential race conditions using synchronization mechanisms like `lock`.

# .NET Core and Framework

## What are the main differences between .NET Framework and .NET Core?

Here are the main differences between .NET Framework and .NET Core:

-   **Cross-platform:** .NET Core is cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS); .NET Framework is Windows-only.
-   **Deployment:** .NET Core allows side-by-side installation; .NET Framework installs globally on Windows.
-   **Open Source:** .NET Core is open-source; .NET Framework is primarily proprietary.
-   **Performance:** .NET Core generally offers better performance than .NET Framework for web applications.
-   **APIs:** .NET Core has a smaller API surface compared to the extensive APIs of .NET Framework.

## Explain the concept of middleware in ASP.NET Core.

In ASP.NET Core, middleware are components that handle requests and responses in the application pipeline. They process HTTP requests, execute logic, and optionally pass requests to the next middleware.

## What are Tag Helpers in ASP.NET Core?

Tag Helpers in ASP.NET Core provide a way to create reusable HTML elements with server-side logic. They simplify HTML syntax and can execute server-side code. Here's an example:

### Example:

```html
<!-- Using a built-in Tag Helper for form validation -->
<form asp-action="SubmitForm" method="post">
    <div class="form-group">
        <label asp-for="Name"></label>
        <input asp-for="Name" class="form-control" />
        <span asp-validation-for="Name" class="text-danger"></span>
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
</form>
```

In this example, `asp-for`, `asp-action`, and `asp-validation-for` are Tag Helpers that generate HTML with server-side bindings and validation attributes based on model properties and actions.

## What is Razor Pages in ASP.NET Core?

Razor Pages is a lightweight web application framework in ASP.NET Core for building web pages. It combines the convenience of Razor syntax (HTML with C#) with the simplicity of page-focused programming model, following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern.

### Key Features:

-   **Page-based:** Each Razor Page corresponds to a .cshtml file representing a discrete page or logical unit.
-   **Model Binding:** Automatically binds page model properties to incoming request data.
-   **Handlers:** Supports handling HTTP verbs (GET, POST, etc.) with corresponding handler methods.
-   **Dependency Injection:** Integrates with ASP.NET Core DI for managing dependencies.

Razor Pages simplify CRUD operations and maintainability in web applications compared to traditional MVC frameworks.

## Explain the use of Filters in ASP.NET Core MVC.

Filters in ASP.NET Core MVC are attributes that can be applied globally or locally to controller actions or entire controllers. They intercept requests and responses to add behavior, such as logging, authorization, or exception handling.

### Example:

```csharp
// Define a custom action filter
public class LogActionFilter : IActionFilter
{
    public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
    {
        // Before action execution
        Console.WriteLine("Action is executing...");
    }

    public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)
    {
        // After action execution
        Console.WriteLine("Action executed.");
    }
}

// Apply the filter to a controller action
[LogActionFilter]
public IActionResult Index()
{
    return View();
}
```

In this example, `LogActionFilter` logs messages before and after the `Index` action execution, demonstrating the use of filters to add cross-cutting concerns to MVC actions.

# Data Access and ORM (EF)

## What is an ORM and why is it useful?

An ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) is a tool that converts data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming and relational databases.
It allows developers to interact with a database using .NET objects, making data manipulation easier and more intuitive.
ORMs simplify CRUD operations, reduce boilerplate code, and improve maintainability by handling database interactions through a higher-level abstraction.
This leads to faster development and fewer errors.

## How do you use Entity Framework for data access?

Using Entity Framework (EF) for data access in ASP.NET Core involves several steps:

1. **Install Entity Framework Core:**
   Ensure EF Core is installed via NuGet package manager.

2. **Define DbContext:**
   Create a class that inherits from `DbContext` and defines DbSet properties for each entity.

    ```csharp
    public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
    {
        public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
        // Other DbSets and configuration
    }
    ```

3. **Configure DbContext:**
   Configure database connection and options in `Startup.cs`.

    ```csharp
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
            options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
    }
    ```

4. **Create and Migrate Database:**
   Use EF Core migrations to create database schema based on DbContext.

    ```
    dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

5. **Use DbContext in Services or Controllers:**
   Inject `ApplicationDbContext` into services or controllers for data access.

    ```csharp
    public class ProductService
    {
        private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

        public ProductService(ApplicationDbContext context)
        {
            _context = context;
        }

        public IEnumerable<Product> GetProducts()
        {
            return _context.Products.ToList();
        }

        // Other CRUD operations
    }
    ```

6. **Query and Manipulate Data:**
   Use LINQ queries to interact with data.

    ```csharp
    var products = _context.Products.Where(p => p.Price > 100).ToList();
    ```

Entity Framework Core simplifies data access by providing an object-relational mapper (ORM) for working with databases in ASP.NET Core applications.

## How do you handle transactions in Entity Framework?

Handling transactions in Entity Framework ensures multiple operations are completed successfully or rolled back together.

### Example:

```csharp
using (var transaction = _context.Database.BeginTransaction())
{
    try
    {
        _context.Products.Add(new Product { Name = "Product1" });
        _context.SaveChanges();

        _context.Orders.Add(new Order { ProductId = 1, Quantity = 10 });
        _context.SaveChanges();

        transaction.Commit();
    }
    catch (Exception)
    {
        transaction.Rollback();
        // Handle exception
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

-   **Begin Transaction:** Start a transaction using `_context.Database.BeginTransaction()`.
-   **Commit:** Call `transaction.Commit()` to save all changes if successful.
-   **Rollback:** Call `transaction.Rollback()` to revert changes if an exception occurs, ensuring atomic operations.

---

# ASP.NET and Web Development

## Explain the MVC pattern.

The MVC pattern in .NET development separates an application into three main components:

-   **Model:** Represents the data and business logic.
-   **View:** Handles the display and user interface.
-   **Controller:** Manages user input and updates the Model and View.

This separation improves code organization, maintainability, and testability by dividing responsibilities among components.

## How do you secure an ASP.NET Core application?

Securing an ASP.NET Core application involves multiple layers:

1. **Authentication:**

    ```csharp
    services.AddAuthentication(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
            .AddCookie(options => { options.LoginPath = "/Account/Login"; });
    ```

2. **Authorization:**

    ```csharp
    services.AddAuthorization(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("AdminPolicy", policy => policy.RequireRole("Admin"));
    });
    ```

3. **Data Protection:**

    ```csharp
    services.AddDataProtection();
    ```

4. **HTTPS Redirection:**

    ```csharp
    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
    ```

5. **CSRF Protection:**

    ```csharp
    services.AddControllersWithViews().AddRazorPagesOptions(options =>
    {
        options.Conventions.ConfigureFilter(new IgnoreAntiforgeryTokenAttribute());
    });
    ```

6. **CORS:**
    ```csharp
    services.AddCors(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("AllowSpecificOrigin",
            builder => builder.WithOrigins("https://example.com")
                              .AllowAnyMethod()
                              .AllowAnyHeader());
    });
    ```

### Explanation:

-   **Authentication:** Configure authentication schemes like cookies.
-   **Authorization:** Define policies for user roles.
-   **Data Protection:** Add data protection services.
-   **HTTPS Redirection:** Force HTTPS for secure communication.
-   **CSRF Protection:** Enable Cross-Site Request Forgery protection.
-   **CORS:** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies.

## What is SignalR and how is it used?

SignalR is a library in ASP.NET Core that provides real-time web functionality. It allows the server to push updates to connected clients instantly, facilitating features like live chat, real-time notifications, and collaborative applications.

### How to Use SignalR:

1. **Configure Services:**
   Add SignalR services in `Startup.cs`.

    ```csharp
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddSignalR();
    }
    ```

2. **Map SignalR Hub:**
   Configure SignalR endpoints in `Startup.cs`.

    ```csharp
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapHub<ChatHub>("/chatHub");
        });
    }
    ```

3. **Create a Hub:**
   Define a hub by inheriting from `Hub`.

    ```csharp
    public class ChatHub : Hub
    {
        public async Task SendMessage(string user, string message)
        {
            await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", user, message);
        }
    }
    ```

4. **Client-Side Code (JavaScript):**
   Connect to the SignalR hub and handle messages.

    ```javascript
    const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder().withUrl('/chatHub').build();

    connection.on('ReceiveMessage', (user, message) => {
        const msg = document.createElement('div');
        msg.textContent = `${user}: ${message}`;
        document.getElementById('messages').appendChild(msg);
    });

    connection.start().catch(err => console.error(err.toString()));

    document.getElementById('sendButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
        const user = document.getElementById('userInput').value;
        const message = document.getElementById('messageInput').value;
        connection.invoke('SendMessage', user, message).catch(err => console.error(err.toString()));
    });
    ```

### Explanation:

-   **Server-Side:**

    -   Add SignalR services in `ConfigureServices`.
    -   Map the SignalR hub in `Configure`.
    -   Create a `Hub` class with methods for client-server communication.

-   **Client-Side:**
    -   Create a connection to the SignalR hub using JavaScript.
    -   Define methods to handle messages from the server.
    -   Start the connection and invoke hub methods for communication.

SignalR abstracts the complexities of managing real-time communications, making it easier to implement interactive and dynamic web applications.

# Testing and Debugging

## What are unit tests and why are they important?

In C#, unit tests are automated tests that validate individual units (methods, classes) of code to ensure they behave as expected.

### Importance of Unit Tests:

1. **Detect Bugs Early:** Identify defects in isolated components before integration.
2. **Ensure Code Quality:** Verify expected behavior against specifications.
3. **Facilitate Refactoring:** Provide confidence when making code changes.

# Performance and Optimization

## How do you optimize the performance of a C# application?

Optimizing the performance of a C# application involves several strategies:

1. **Use StringBuilder for String Concatenation:**

    ```csharp
    var sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
    {
        sb.Append(i.ToString());
    }
    var result = sb.ToString();
    ```

2. **Minimize Object Instantiation in Loops:**

    ```csharp
    var list = new List<int>();
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
    {
        list.Add(i); // Move instantiation outside loop if possible
    }
    ```

3. **Optimize LINQ Queries:**

    ```csharp
    var result = data.Where(d => d.Value > 100).ToList();
    ```

4. **Use Asynchronous Programming (async/await):**

    ```csharp
    public async Task<int> GetDataAsync()
    {
        // Await async operations
    }
    ```

5. **Implement Caching for Expensive Operations:**
    ```csharp
    var cacheKey = "dataCacheKey";
    var cachedData = memoryCache.Get(cacheKey);
    if (cachedData == null)
    {
        // Retrieve data and cache it
        memoryCache.Set(cacheKey, data, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60));
    }
    ```

Applying these techniques can significantly enhance the performance of your C# applications by reducing overhead, optimizing resource usage, and improving responsiveness.

## How do you handle large data sets in C#?

Handling large datasets in C# requires strategies to manage memory efficiently and process data in manageable chunks:

1. **Streaming Data Reading:**

    ```csharp
    using (var stream = File.OpenRead(filePath))
    using (var reader = new StreamReader(stream))
    {
        string line;
        while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null)
        {
            // Process each line
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Batch Processing with Paging:**

    ```csharp
    var pageSize = 1000;
    var page = 0;
    var dataSubset = dataList.Skip(page * pageSize).Take(pageSize);
    foreach (var data in dataSubset)
    {
        // Process each data item
    }
    ```

3. **Async/Await for Parallel Processing:**

    ```csharp
    var tasks = new List<Task>();
    foreach (var data in dataList)
    {
        tasks.Add(ProcessDataAsync(data));
    }
    await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
    ```

4. **Database Pagination (Entity Framework Core):**
    ```csharp
    var page = 0;
    var pageSize = 1000;
    var dataSubset = dbContext.Products.Skip(page * pageSize).Take(pageSize).ToList();
    ```

These examples illustrate approaches to handle large datasets effectively in C#, using techniques such as streaming, batching, asynchronous processing, and database pagination to optimize performance and memory usage.

## How do you optimize database access in C#?

To optimize database access in C#, consider these approaches:

1. **Use Efficient Queries:**

    ```csharp
    var highPriceProducts = dbContext.Products.Where(p => p.Price > 100).ToList();
    ```

2. **Use Compiled Queries (Entity Framework Core):**

    ```csharp
    var query = dbContext.Products
                         .Where(p => p.Price > 100)
                         .AsQueryable()
                         .Compile(); // Compiles the query
    var highPriceProducts = query.ToList();
    ```

3. **Batch Operations (BulkExtensions library for Entity Framework Core):**

    ```csharp
    await dbContext.BulkInsertAsync(newProducts);
    ```

4. **Optimize Data Retrieval with Projections:**

    ```csharp
    var productNames = dbContext.Products
                                 .Where(p => p.Price > 100)
                                 .Select(p => p.Name)
                                 .ToList();
    ```

5. **Database Indexing:**
   Ensure appropriate indexing on columns frequently used in queries.

6. **Connection Management:**
   Utilize connection pooling to efficiently manage database connections.

These examples illustrate ways to improve database access performance in C# applications, leveraging techniques like efficient querying, compiled queries, batch operations, and proper data retrieval strategies.

# Miscellaneous

## What is a RESTful API and how do you create one in C#?

A RESTful API is an API that follows REST principles, using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations on resources, which are identified by URLs.

### Creating a RESTful API in C#:

1. **Setup ASP.NET Core Web API Project:**

    ```bash
    dotnet new webapi -n MyApi
    ```

2. **Define a Model:**

    ```csharp
    public class Product
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public decimal Price { get; set; }
    }
    ```

3. **Create a Controller:**

    ```csharp
    [ApiController]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
    {
        private static List<Product> products = new List<Product>
        {
            new Product { Id = 1, Name = "Product1", Price = 10.0m }
        };

        [HttpGet]
        public IEnumerable<Product> Get() => products;

        [HttpPost]
        public void Post(Product product) => products.Add(product);
    }
    ```

### Explanation:

-   **Setup Project:** Create an ASP.NET Core Web API project.
-   **Model:** Define a `Product` model.
-   **Controller:** Create a `ProductsController` to handle GET and POST requests.

## How do you handle JSON data in C#?

In C#, JSON data is handled using the `System.Text.Json` or `Newtonsoft.Json` library.

### Example using `System.Text.Json`:

1. **Serialize an object to JSON:**

    ```csharp
    using System.Text.Json;

    var person = new { Name = "John", Age = 30 };
    string jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(person);
    ```

2. **Deserialize JSON to an object:**
    ```csharp
    string json = "{\"Name\":\"John\",\"Age\":30}";
    var person = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Person>(json);
    ```

### Explanation:

-   **Serialize:** Convert an object to a JSON string.
-   **Deserialize:** Convert a JSON string to an object.

## What is a microservice and how do you implement one in .NET Core?

A microservice is a small, independently deployable service that focuses on a specific business function.

Each microservice runs in its own process, communicates via lightweight protocols (usually HTTP/REST), and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

This architecture enhances modularity, making applications more flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain.
